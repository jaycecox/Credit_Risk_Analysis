# Credit_Risk_Analysis
# Purpose 
To use different techniques to train and evaluate models based on a credit card dataset with unbalanced classes.  We will be assessing credit risk using models that will oversample the data, under sample the data, or use a combination of the two to sample the data.  Then we will use two machine learning models that reduced bias and predict credit risk.
